Some hints on inputs (frequent Bilibili users should have known these):

1. For Video ID (av number), try number under 16 million. (The current highest ID is somewhere between 16 and 17 million.) Among them, there are around 9 million valid IDs with the smallest one being 7. The most viewed video is 4709603, but is not a classic example for testing. The most famous video on this website is 11089492.

2. For User ID, just try some number with no more than 7 digits. Most of them should work. 7483880 is me. 883968, 122879, and 1532165 are some famous uploaders.

Known bug(s):
- Doesn't disable user interaction when the content is not fully loaded in Video / User Search scene. It might crash if user attempts to tap on a button / cell.
